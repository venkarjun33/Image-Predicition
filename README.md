# Image-Predicition

This repository contains code for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict image categories. CNNs are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image recognition and classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from image data.

The project aims to demonstrate the process of building and training a CNN model for image prediction. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of images and then evaluated on unseen data to assess its performance. The repository provides scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

After training and evaluating the model, the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be found in the evaluation results. Additionally, sample predictions on test images can be visualized along with their corresponding ground truth labels.
